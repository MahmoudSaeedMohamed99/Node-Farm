# Node-Farm
My first Node.js Project

How to start the project :

First : download the folder or make a clone .    
Second : you have to install Node.js on your pc .    
Third : open cmd and then right node -v to test that you did install Node.js .    
Forth : run index.js file like that ( node index.js ) .    

Finally you can test my project and i hope you will enjoy it , Thanks :)
